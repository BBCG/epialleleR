\arguments{
\item{bam}{BAM file location string OR preprocessed output of
\code{\link{preprocessBam}} function}

\item{report.file}{file location string to write the cytosine report. If NULL
(the default) then report is returned as a
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object}

\item{threshold.reads}{boolean defining if sequence reads should be
thresholded before counting methylated cytosines (default: TRUE). Disabling
thresholding makes the report virtually indistinguishable from the ones
generated by other software, such as Bismark or Illumina DRAGEN Bio IT
Platform}

\item{threshold.context}{string defining cytosine methylation context used
for thresholdning the reads
\itemize{
  \item "CG" (the default) -- within-the-context: CpG cytosines (called as
  zZ), out-of-context: all the other cytosines (hHxX)
  \item "CHG" -- within-the-context: CHG cytosines (xX), out-of-context: hHzZ
  \item "CHH" -- within-the-context: CHH cytosines (hH), out-of-context: xXzZ
  \item "CxG" -- within-the-context: CG and CHG cytosines (zZxX),
  out-of-context: CHH cytosines (hH)
  \item "CX" -- all cytosines are considered within-the-context, this
  effectively results in no thresholdning
}
This option has no effect when read thresholding is disabled}

\item{min.context.sites}{non-negative integer for minimum number of cytosines
within the `threshold.context` (default: 2). Reads containing *fewer*
within-the-context cytosines are considered completely unmethylated (all C
are counted as T). This option has no effect when read thresholding is
disabled}

\item{min.context.beta}{real number in the range [0;1] (default: 0.5). Reads
with average beta value for within-the-context cytosines *below* this
threshold are considered completely unmethylated (all C are counted as T).
This option has no effect when read thresholding is disabled}

\item{max.outofcontext.beta}{real number in the range [0;1] (default: 0.1).
Reads with average beta value for out-of-context cytosines *above* this
threshold are considered completely unmethylated (all C are counted as T).
This option has no effect when read thresholding is disabled}

\item{report.context}{string defining cytosine methylation context to report
(default: value of `threshold.context`)}

\item{min.mapq}{non-negative integer threshold for minimum read mapping
quality (default: 0). Option has no effect if preprocessed BAM data was
supplied as an input}

\item{skip.duplicates}{boolean defining if duplicate aligned reads should be
skipped (default: FALSE). Option has no effect if preprocessed BAM data was
supplied as an input OR duplicate reads were not marked by alignment software}

\item{gzip}{boolean to compress the report (default: FALSE)}

\item{verbose}{boolean to report progress and timings (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object containing cytosine
report in Bismark format or NULL if report.file was specified. The report
columns are:
\itemize{
  \item rname -- reference sequence name (as in BAM)
  \item strand -- strand
  \item pos -- cytosine position
  \item context -- methylation context
  \item meth -- number of methylated cytosines
  \item unmeth -- number of unmethylated cytosines
  \item triad -- sequence spanning region [<pos>:<pos+2>]. Always equals to
  "NNN" due to the reference genome-independent reporting
}

\description{
`generateCytosineReport` This function counts methylated and unmethylated
DNA bases taking into the account average methylation level of the entire
sequence read
}
\details{
The function reports cytosine methylation information using BAM file as an
input. In contrast to the other currently available software, reads can be
thresholded by their average methylation level before counting methylated
bases, effectively resulting in hypermethylated Variant Epiallele Frequency
(VEF) being reported instead of beta value. Here's how it works:
Let's suppose we have a BAM file with four reads mapped to chromosome 1 
positions 1-16. Assuming the default thresholding parameters (threshold.reads
= TRUE, threshold.context = "CG", min.context.sites = 2, min.context.beta =
0.5, max.outofcontext.beta = 0.1), the input and results will look as
following:

| read chr:strand:start | methylation string | threshold | reason | methylation reported |
| chr1:+:1 | ...Z..x+.h..x..h. | below | min.context.sites < 2 (only one zZ base) | C at position 4: unmethylated |
| chr1:+:1 | ...Z..z.h..x..h.  | above | pass all criteria | C4: methylated, C7: unmethylated |
| chr1:+:1 | ...Z..z.h..X..h.  | below | max.outofcontext.beta > 0.1 (1XH / 3xXhH = 0.33) | C4 and C7: unmethylated |
| chr1:+:1 | ...Z..z.h..z-.h.  | below | min.context.beta < 0.5 (1Z / 3zZ = 0.33) | C4 and C7: unmethylated |

Only the second read will satisfy all the thresholding criteria, leading to
the following CX report:

| rname | strand | pos | context | meth | unmeth | triad |
| chr1 | + | 4 | CG | 1 | 3 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 7 | CG | 0 | 3 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 9 | CHH | 0 | 4 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 12 | CHG | 0 | 3 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 15 | CHH | 0 | 4 | NNN |

With the thresholding disabled (threshold.reads = FALSE) all methylated bases
will retain their status, so the CX report will be similar to the reports
produced by other methylation callers (such as Bismark or Illumina DRAGEN Bio
IT Platform):

| rname | strand | pos | context | meth | unmeth | triad |
| chr1 | + | 4 | CG | 4 | 0 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 7 | CG | 0 | 3 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 9 | CHH | 0 | 4 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 12 | CHG | 1 | 2 | NNN |
| chr1 | + | 15 | CHH | 0 | 4 | NNN |

Other notes:

Methylation string bases in unknown context ("uU") are simply ignored, which,
to the best of our knowledge, is consistent with the behaviour of other
tools.

In order to mitigate sequencing errors (leading to rare variations in the
methylation context, as in reads 1 and 4 above), the context present in more
than 50% of the reads is assumed to be correct, while all bases at the same
position but having other methylation context are simply ignored. This allows
reports to be prepared without using the reference genome sequence.

The downside of not using the reference genome sequence is the inability to
determine the actual sequnce of triplet for every base in the cytosine 
report. For now the sequence is reported as "NNN" and this will stay until
such information will be considered as worth adding.
