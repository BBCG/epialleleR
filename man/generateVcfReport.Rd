\arguments{
\item{bam}{BAM file location string OR preprocessed output of
\code{\link[epialleleR]{preprocessBam}} function. BAM file alignment records
must contain XG tag (strand information for the reference genome) and
methylation call string (XM tag). Read more about these and other
requirements and BAM preprocessing at \code{\link{preprocessBam}}.}

\item{vcf}{Variant Call Format (VCF) file location string OR a VCF object
returned by \code{\link[VariantAnnotation]{readVcf}} function. If VCF object
is supplied, the style of its seqlevels must match the style of seqlevels of
the BAM file/object used.}

\item{vcf.style}{string for the seqlevels style of the VCF file, if
different from BED file/object. Only has effect when `vcf` parameter points
to the VCF file location and `bed` is not NULL. Possible values:
\itemize{
  \item NULL (the default) -- seqlevels in BED file/object and VCF file are
  the same
  \item "NCBI", "UCSC", ... -- valid parameters of
  \code{\link[GenomeInfoDb]{seqlevelsStyle}} function
}}

\item{bed}{Browser Extensible Data (BED) file location string OR object of
class \code{\linkS4class{GRanges}} holding genomic coordinates for
regions of interest. It is used to include only the specific genomic ranges
when the VCF file is loaded. This option has no effect when VCF object is
supplied as a `vcf` parameter. The style of seqlevels of BED file/object
must match the style of seqlevels of the BAM file/object used.}

\item{report.file}{file location string to write the VCF report. If NULL
(the default) then report is returned as a
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object.}

\item{zero.based.bed}{boolean defining if BED coordinates are zero based
(default: FALSE).}

\item{threshold.reads}{boolean defining if sequence reads should be
thresholded before counting bases in reference and variant epialleles
(default: TRUE). Disabling thresholding is possible but makes no sense in
this context as all the reads will be assigned to the variant epiallele,
which will result in Fisher's Exact test p-value of 1 (in columns `FEp+` and
`FEP-`).}

\item{threshold.context}{string defining cytosine methylation context used
for thresholding the reads:
\itemize{
  \item "CG" (the default) -- within-the-context: CpG cytosines (called as
  zZ), out-of-context: all the other cytosines (hHxX)
  \item "CHG" -- within-the-context: CHG cytosines (xX), out-of-context: hHzZ
  \item "CHH" -- within-the-context: CHH cytosines (hH), out-of-context: xXzZ
  \item "CxG" -- within-the-context: CG and CHG cytosines (zZxX),
  out-of-context: CHH cytosines (hH)
  \item "CX" -- all cytosines are considered within-the-context, this
  effectively results in no thresholding
}
This option has no effect when read thresholding is disabled.}

\item{min.context.sites}{non-negative integer for minimum number of cytosines
within the `threshold.context` (default: 2). Reads containing \strong{fewer}
within-the-context cytosines are considered completely unmethylated (thus
belonging to the reference epiallele). This option has no effect when read
thresholding is disabled.}

\item{min.context.beta}{real number in the range [0;1] (default: 0.5). Reads
with average beta value for within-the-context cytosines \strong{below} this
threshold are considered completely unmethylated (thus belonging to the
reference epiallele). This option has no effect when read thresholding is
disabled.}

\item{max.outofcontext.beta}{real number in the range [0;1] (default: 0.1).
Reads with average beta value for out-of-context cytosines \strong{above}
this threshold are considered completely unmethylated (thus belonging to the
reference epiallele). This option has no effect when read thresholding is
disabled.}

\item{...}{other parameters to pass to the
\code{\link[epialleleR]{preprocessBam}} function.
Options have no effect if preprocessed BAM data was supplied as an input.}

\item{gzip}{boolean to compress the report (default: FALSE).}

\item{verbose}{boolean to report progress and timings (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object containing VCF report or
NULL if report.file was specified. The report columns are:
\itemize{
  \item name -- variation identifier (e.g. "rs123456789")
  \item seqnames -- reference sequence name
  \item range -- genomic coordinates of the variation
  \item REF -- base at the reference allele
  \item ALT -- base at the alternative allele
  \item [M|U][+|-][Ref|Alt] -- number of \strong{Ref}erence or
  \strong{Alt}ernative bases that were found at this particular position
  within \strong{M}ethylated (above threshold) or \strong{U}nmethylated
  (below threshold) reads that were mapped to \strong{"+"} (forward)
  or \strong{"-"} (reverse) DNA strand. NA values mean that it is not
  possible to determine the number of bases due to the bisulfite
  conversion-related limitations (C->T variants on "+" and G->A on "-"
  strands)
  \item SumRef -- sum of all \strong{Ref}erence base counts
  \item SumAlt -- sum of all \strong{Alt}ernative base counts
  \item FEp+ -- Fisher Exact test p-value for association of a variation
  with methylation status of the reads that map to the \strong{"+"}
  (forward) DNA strand. Calculated using following contingency table:
  \tabular{ll}{
    M+Ref \tab M+Alt \cr
    U+Ref \tab U+Alt 
  }
  
  \item FEp- -- Fisher Exact test p-value for association of a variation
  with methylation status of the reads that map to the \strong{"-"}
  (reverse) DNA strand. Calculated using following contingency table:
  \tabular{ll}{
    M-Ref \tab M-Alt \cr
    U-Ref \tab U-Alt 
  }
}
}
\description{
This function calculates base frequencies at particular genomic positions and
tests their association with the methylation status of the sequencing reads.
}
\details{
Using BAM reads and sequence variation information as an input,
`generateVcfReport` function thresholds the reads (for paired-end sequencing
alignment files - read pairs as a single
entity) according to supplied parameters and calculates the occurrence of
\strong{Ref}erence and \strong{Alt}ernative bases within reads, taking into
the account DNA strand the read mapped to and average methylation level
(epiallele status) of the read.

The information on sequence variation can be supplied as a Variant Call
Format (VCF) file location or an object of class VCF, returned by the
\code{\link[VariantAnnotation]{readVcf}} function call. As whole-genome VCF
files can be extremely large, it is strongly advised to use only relevant
subset of their data, prefiltering the VCF object manually before calling
`generateVcfReport` or specifying `bed` parameter when `vcf` points to the
location of such large VCF file. Please note that all the BAM, BED and VCF
files must use the same style for seqlevels (i.e. chromosome names).

After counting, function checks if certain bases occur more often within
reads belonging to certain epialleles using Fisher Exact test
(HTSlib's own implementation) and reports separate p-values for reads
mapped to \strong{"+"} (forward) and \strong{"-"} (reverse) DNA strands.

Please note that the final report currently includes only the VCF entries
with single-base REF and ALT alleles. Also, the default (`min.baseq=0`)
output of `generateVcfReport` is equivalent to the one of
`samtools mplieup -Q 0 ...`, and therefore may result in false SNVs caused
by misalignments. Remember to increase `min.baseq` (`samtools mplieup -Q`
default value is 13) to obtain higher-quality results.
