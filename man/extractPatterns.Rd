\arguments{
\item{bam}{BAM file location string OR preprocessed output of
\code{\link[epialleleR]{preprocessBam}} function. Read more about BAM file
requirements and BAM preprocessing at \code{\link{preprocessBam}}.}

\item{bed}{Browser Extensible Data (BED) file location string OR object of
class \code{\linkS4class{GRanges}} holding genomic coordinates for
regions of interest. It is used to match sequencing reads to the genomic
regions for pattern extraction. The style of seqlevels of BED file/object
must match the style of seqlevels of the BAM file/object used. The 
BED/\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} rows are \strong{not} sorted
internally. As of now, the strand information is ignored and patterns
matching both strands are extracted.}

\item{bed.row}{single non-negative integer specifying what `bed` region
should be included in the output (default: 1).}

\item{zero.based.bed}{boolean defining if BED coordinates are zero based
(default: FALSE).}

\item{match.min.overlap}{integer for the smallest overlap between read's and
BED/\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} start or end positions during
matching of capture-based NGS reads (default: 1).}

\item{extract.context}{string defining cytosine methylation context used
to report:
\itemize{
  \item "CG" (the default) -- CpG cytosines (called as zZ)
  \item "CHG" -- CHG cytosines (xX)
  \item "CHH" -- CHH cytosines (hH)
  \item "CxG" -- CG and CHG cytosines (zZxX)
  \item "CX" -- all cytosines
}}

\item{min.context.freq}{real number in the range [0;1] (default: 0.01).
Genomic positions that are covered by smaller fraction of patterns (e.g.,
with erroneous context) won't be included in the report.}

\item{clip.patterns}{boolean if patterns should not extend over the edge of
`bed` region (default: FALSE).}

\item{strand.offset}{single non-negative integer specifying the offset of
bases at the reverse (-) strand compared to the forward (+) strand. Allows
to "merge" genomic positions when methylation is symmetric (in CG and CHG
contexts). By default, equals 1 for `extract.context`=="CG", 2 for "CHG", or
0 otherwise.}

\item{highlight.positions}{integer vector with genomic positions of bases
to include in every overlapping pattern. Allows to visualize the
distribution of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) among methylation
patterns. `highlight.positions` takes precedence if any of these positions
overlap with within-the-context positions of methylation pattern.}

\item{...}{other parameters to pass to the
\code{\link[epialleleR]{preprocessBam}} function.
Options have no effect if preprocessed BAM data was supplied as an input.}

\item{verbose}{boolean to report progress and timings (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object containing
per-read (pair) base methylation information for the genomic region of
interest. The report columns are:
\itemize{
  \item seqnames -- read (pair) reference sequence name
  \item strand -- read (pair) strand
  \item start -- start of the read (pair)
  \item end -- end of the read (pair)
  \item nbase -- number of within-the-context bases for this read (pair)
  \item beta -- beta value of this read (pair), calculated as a ratio of the
  number of methylated within-the-context bases to the total number of
  within-the-context bases
  \item pattern -- hex representation of 64-bit FNV-1a hash calculated for
  all reported base positions and bases in this read (pair). This
  hash value depends only on included genomic positions and their methylation
  call string chars (hHxXzZ) or nucleotides (ACGT, for highlighted bases
  only), thus it is expected to be unique for every
  methylation pattern, although equal for identical methylation patterns
  independently on read (pair) start, end, or strand (when correct
  `strand.offset` is given)
  \item ... -- columns for each genomic position that hold corresponding
  methylation call string char, or NA if position is not present in the read
  (pair)
}
}
\description{
This function extracts methylation patterns (epialleles) for a given genomic
region of interest.
}
\details{
The function matches reads (for paired-end sequencing alignment files - read
pairs as a single entity) to the genomic
region provided in a BED file/\code{\linkS4class{GRanges}} object, extracts
methylation statuses of bases within those reads, and returns a data frame
which can be used for plotting of DNA methylation patterns.
