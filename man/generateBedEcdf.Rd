\arguments{
\item{bam}{BAM file location string OR preprocessed output of
\code{\link{preprocessBam}} function.}

\item{bed}{Browser Extensible Data (BED) file location string OR object of
class \code{\linkS4class{GRanges}} holding genomic coordinates for
regions of interest. It is used to match sequencing reads to the genomic
regions prior to eCDF computation. The seqlevels of BED file/object must
match the seqlevels of the BAM file/object used.}

\item{bed.type}{character string for the type of assay that was used to
produce sequencing reads:
\itemize{
  \item "amplicon" (the default) -- used for amplicon-based next-generation
  sequencing when exact coordinates of sequenced fragments are known.
  Matching of reads to genomic ranges are then performed by the read's start
  or end positions, either of which should be no further than
  `match.tolerance` bases away from the start or end position of genomic
  ranges given in BED file/\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object
  \item "capture" -- used for capture-based next-generation sequencing when
  reads partially overlap with the capture target regions. Read is considered
  to match the genomic range when their overlap is more or equal to
  `match.min.overlap`. If read matches two or more BED genomic regions, only
  the first match is taken (input \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} are
  \strong{not} sorted internally)
}}

\item{bed.rows}{integer vector specifying what `bed` regions should be
included in the output. If `c(1)` (the default), then function returns eCDF
for either first region of `bed` or for reads that don't match any regions}
