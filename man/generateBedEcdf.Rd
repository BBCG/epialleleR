\arguments{
\item{bam}{BAM file location string OR preprocessed output of
\code{\link{preprocessBam}} function. BAM file alignment records
must derive from paired-end sequencing, be sorted
by QNAME (instead of genomic position), contain XG tag (strand information
for the reference genome) and methylation call strings. Read more about
these requirements and BAM preprocessing at \code{\link{preprocessBam}}.}

\item{bed}{Browser Extensible Data (BED) file location string OR object of
class \code{\linkS4class{GRanges}} holding genomic coordinates for
regions of interest. It is used to match sequencing reads to the genomic
regions prior to eCDF computation. The seqlevels of BED file/object must
match the seqlevels of the BAM file/object used.}

\item{bed.type}{character string for the type of assay that was used to
produce sequencing reads:
\itemize{
  \item "amplicon" (the default) -- used for amplicon-based next-generation
  sequencing when exact coordinates of sequenced fragments are known.
  Matching of reads to genomic ranges are then performed by the read's start
  or end positions, either of which should be no further than
  `match.tolerance` bases away from the start or end position of genomic
  ranges given in BED file/\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object
  \item "capture" -- used for capture-based next-generation sequencing when
  reads partially overlap with the capture target regions. Read is considered
  to match the genomic range when their overlap is more or equal to
  `match.min.overlap`. If read matches two or more BED genomic regions, only
  the first match is taken (input \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} are
  \strong{not} sorted internally)
}}

\item{bed.rows}{integer vector specifying what `bed` regions should be
included in the output. If `c(1)` (the default), then function returns eCDFs
for the first region of `bed`, if NULL - eCDF functions for all `bed`
genomic regions as well as for the reads that didn't match any of the regions
(last element of the return value; only if there are such reads).}

\item{zero.based.bed}{boolean defining if BED coordinates are zero based
(default: FALSE).}

\item{match.tolerance}{integer for the largest difference between read's and
BED \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} start or end positions during
matching of amplicon-based NGS reads (default: 1).}

\item{match.min.overlap}{integer for the smallest overlap between read's and
BED \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} start or end positions during
matching of capture-based NGS reads (default: 1). If read matches two or more
BED genomic regions, only the first match is taken (input
\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} are \strong{not} sorted internally).}

\item{ecdf.context}{string defining cytosine methylation context used
for computing within-the-context and out-of-context eCDFs:
\itemize{
  \item "CG" (the default) -- within-the-context: CpG cytosines (called as
  zZ), out-of-context: all the other cytosines (hHxX)
  \item "CHG" -- within-the-context: CHG cytosines (xX), out-of-context: hHzZ
  \item "CHH" -- within-the-context: CHH cytosines (hH), out-of-context: xXzZ
  \item "CxG" -- within-the-context: CG and CHG cytosines (zZxX),
  out-of-context: CHH cytosines (hH)
  \item "CX" -- all cytosines are considered within-the-context
}}

\item{min.mapq}{non-negative integer threshold for minimum read mapping
quality (default: 0). Option has no effect if preprocessed BAM data was
supplied as an input.}

\item{min.baseq}{non-negative integer threshold for minimum nucleotide base
quality (default: 0). Option has no effect if preprocessed BAM data was
supplied as an input.}

\item{skip.duplicates}{boolean defining if duplicate aligned reads should be
skipped (default: FALSE). Option has no effect if preprocessed BAM data was
supplied as an input OR duplicate reads were not marked by alignment
software.}

\item{nthreads}{non-negative integer for the number of HTSlib threads to be
used during BAM file decompression (default: 1). 2 threads make sense for the
files larger than 100 MB. Option has no effect if preprocessed BAM data was
supplied as an input.}

\item{verbose}{boolean to report progress and timings (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
list with a number of elements equal to the length of `bed.rows` (if
not NULL), or to the number of genomic regions within `bed` (if 
`bed.rows==NULL`) plus one item for all reads not matching `bed` genomic
regions (if any). Every list item is a list on it's own, consisting of two
eCDF functions for within- and out-of-context per-read beta values.
}
\description{
This function computes empirical cumulative distribution functions (eCDF) for
per-read beta values of the sequencing reads.
}
\details{
The function matches reads (or read pairs as a single entity) to the genomic
regions provided in a BED file/\code{\linkS4class{GRanges}} object, computes
average per-read beta values according to the cytosine context parameter
`ecdf.context`, and returns a list of eCDFs for within- and out-of-context
average per-read beta values, which can be used for plotting.

The resulting eCDFs and their plots can be used to characterise the
methylation pattern of a particular genomic region, e.g. if reads that match
to that region are methylated in an "all-CpGs-or-none" manner or if some
intermediate methylation levels are more frequent.
