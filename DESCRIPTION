Description: Epialleles are specific DNA methylation patterns that are
  mitotically and/or meiotically inherited. This package calls and reports
  cytosine methylation as well as frequencies of hypermethylated
  epialleles at the level of genomic regions or individual cytosines
  in next-generation sequencing data using binary alignment map (BAM) files as
  an input. Among other things, this package can also extract methylation
  patterns and assess allele specificity of methylation.
