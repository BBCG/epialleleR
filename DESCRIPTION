Description: Epialleles are specific DNA methylation patterns that are
  mitotically and/or meiotically inherited. This package calls hypermethylated
  epiallele frequencies at the level of genomic regions or individual cytosines
  in next-generation sequencing data using binary alignment map (BAM) files as
  an input. Other functionality includes extracting methylation patterns,
  computing the empirical cumulative distribution function for per-read beta
  values, and testing the significance of the association between epiallele
  methylation status and base frequencies at particular genomic positions
  (SNPs).
